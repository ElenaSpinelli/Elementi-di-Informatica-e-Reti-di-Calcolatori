        <p>Hello, I'm Elena Spinelli, a twenty-one-year-old Interior Design student at Politecnico di Milano, and this is my website.</p>
        <p>In this website I'd like to show you my most important works in various connected fields, like interior design, graphics, painting and, in general, art. </p>
        <p>I try to have a modern, wide, differentiated approach to art, taking inspiration from very different things (in short words, from anything that catches my eye). This is probably also an effect of my education, since I studied Classics at high school, while now I'm focusing on Design, thus having more than one way to understand and make art. </p>
        <p> I'm curious and creative, open to a wide variety of life and artistic experiences, always in search of a way to improve myself and enrich my culture. I consider myself as a world citizen and I think that new generations should have a global, international view, taking the best of any culture which they have to deal with.</p>
        <p> I hope you'll find my website interesting â€“ in any case, just know that I put all my effort in it!
        Good surfing!</p></td>
